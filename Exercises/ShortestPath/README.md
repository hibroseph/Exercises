## Shortest Path Robot
---
This is an adaptation from an Amazon interview question that I did not successfully complete. You are given a robot in a specific position and it needs to find
the shortest path to the exit. A map is given to you which is a list of lists. 1 indicates a valid move, 0 indicates a wall (or an invalid move), 2 indicates the start
position, and 3 denotes the exit. Return the shortest number of moves it took to get to the exit, or 0 if it is not possible
